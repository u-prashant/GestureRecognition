# GestureRecognition

## Problem Statement

Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

* Thumbs up:  Increase the volume <br>
  ![Thumbs Up](thumbs_up.gif)

* Thumbs down: Decrease the volume <br>
  ![Thumbs Down](thumbs_down.gif)

* Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds <br>
  ![Left Swipe](left_swipe.gif)

* Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds <br>
  ![Right Swipe](right_swipe.gif)

* Stop: Pause the movie <br>
